# How TUITPay Works

TUITPay functions within a closed-loop blockchain ecosystem that supports tuition redemption and transparency for sponsors.

## 1. Student Registration
- KYC and school API verification
- Assigned unique student ID within platform

## 2. Token Generation
- Students earn $TUIT tokens through:
  - Academic performance (i.e completing online courses)
  - Mining
- Tokens are stored in user wallet (non-transferrable outside ecosystem)

## 3. Redemption & Escrow Activation
- Student selects partner institution
- Redeems earned tokens for tuition
- TUITPay triggers sponsor-funded smart escrow
- School receives fiat directly

## 4. Reporting & Impact
- Sponsors and investors access dashboards
- Real-time insights: # of students helped, token flow, academic impact
